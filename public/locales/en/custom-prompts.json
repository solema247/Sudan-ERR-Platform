  "prompt": "The following text has been extracted from a handwritten financial report form using OCR. The text may contain errors due to the OCR process. Your task is to carefully read the text and extract the relevant information, organizing it into the following JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"project_metadata\": {\n    \"project_objectives\": \"${projectMetadata.project_objectives}\",\n    \"beneficiaries\": \"${projectMetadata.intended_beneficiaries}\"\n  },\n  \"err_id\": \"${projectMetadata.err_id}\",\n  \"expenses\": [\n    {\n      \"activity\": \"${expenses.activity}\",\n      \"description\": \"Description of Expenses\",\n      \"amount\": \"Expense Amount\",\n      \"seller\": \"Seller/Recipient Details\",\n      \"payment_method\": \"Payment Method (Cash/Bank App)\",\n      \"receipt_no\": \"Receipt Number\"\n    }\n    // Add all detected expense items from the text in a tabular structure\n  ],\n  \"financial_summary\": {\n    \"total_expenses\": \"${financial_summary.total_expenses}\",\n    \"total_grant_received\": \"${financial_summary.total_grant_received}\",\n    \"remainder\": \"${financial_summary.remainder}\"\n  },\n  \"unused_text\": {\n    \"likely_ocr_errors\": \"Text segments that are likely OCR errors\",\n    \"potentially_useful_information\": \"Text segments that may contain useful information not captured in the fields above\"\n  }\n}\n\nPlease follow these instructions carefully:\n\n1. Extract all relevant information and organize it into the specified JSON structure.\n2. Use the \"project_metadata\" fields (e.g., \"project_objectives\", \"beneficiaries\", and \"err_id\") as provided by the system.\n3. Use the \"financial_summary\" fields (e.g., \"total_grant_received\", \"total_expenses\", \"remainder\") as provided by the system.\n4. Detect and structure tables in the text (e.g., rows of items, quantities, and prices) into the \"expenses\" array. Ensure proper alignment of columns like \"Description\", \"Amount\", and \"Seller\".\n5. If you cannot find some information, leave the field empty or use \"Not available\".\n6. Maintain the exact JSON structure provided, including empty fields if necessary.\n7. Categorize remaining text into two categories:\n   - \"likely_ocr_errors\": Text that appears to be OCR errors or artifacts.\n   - \"potentially_useful_information\": Text that may contain additional details not captured in the fields above.\n\nHere is the text:\n\n${cleanedText}\n\nReturn the information in JSON format only, without additional explanation."
