  "prompt": "The following text has been extracted from a handwritten financial report form using OCR. The text may contain errors due to the OCR process. Your task is to carefully read the text and extract the relevant information, organizing it into the following JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"project_metadata\": {\n    \"project_objectives\": \"${projectMetadata.project_objectives}\",\n    \"beneficiaries\": \"${projectMetadata.intended_beneficiaries}\"\n  },\n  \"date\": \"DD/MM/YYYY\",\n  \"err_id\": \"${projectMetadata.err_id}\",\n  \"expenses\": [\n    {\n      \"activity\": \"${expenses.activity}\",\n      \"description\": \"Description of Expenses\",\n      \"payment_date\": \"DD/MM\",\n      \"seller\": \"Seller/Recipient Details\",\n      \"payment_method\": \"Payment Method (Cash/Bank App)\",\n      \"receipt_no\": \"Receipt Number\",\n      \"amount\": \"Expense Amount\"\n    }\n    // Add as many items as detected from the OCR text\n  ],\n  \"financial_summary\": {\n    \"total_expenses\": \"${financial_summary.total_expenses}\",\n    \"total_grant_received\": \"${financial_summary.total_grant_received}\",\n    \"total_other_sources\": \"Total Amount from Other Sources\",\n    \"remainder\": \"${financial_summary.remainder}\"\n  },\n  \"additional_questions\": {\n    \"excess_expenses\": \"Response on covering excess expenses\",\n    \"surplus_use\": \"Response on use of surplus\",\n    \"lessons_learned\": \"Response on lessons learned from budget planning\",\n    \"training_needs\": \"Response on additional training needs\"\n  },\n  \"unused_text\": {\n    \"likely_ocr_errors\": \"Text segments that are likely OCR errors\",\n    \"potentially_useful_information\": \"Text segments that may contain useful information not captured in the fields above\"\n  }\n}\n\nPlease follow these instructions:\n\n1. Extract all relevant information from the text and organize it into the JSON structure.\n2. Use the \"project_metadata\" fields (e.g., \"project_objectives\", \"beneficiaries\", and \"err_id\") as provided values from the system.\n3. Use the \"financial_summary\" fields (e.g., \"total_grant_received\", \"total_expenses\", \"remainder\") as provided values from the system.\n4. Use the \"activity\" field in \"expenses\" as provided from the system if not available in the text.\n5. Add each detected expense item as a separate object in the \"expenses\" array, even if only partial details are available.\n6. If you cannot find some information, leave the field empty or write \"Not available\".\n7. Maintain the exact JSON structure provided, including empty fields if necessary.\n8. Categorize any remaining text into two categories:\n   - \"likely_ocr_errors\": Text that appears to be errors from the OCR process.\n   - \"potentially_useful_information\": Text that may be important but was not included in the fields above.\n9. Avoid adding any information that is not explicitly present in the text.\n\nHere is the text:\n\n${cleanedText}\n\nReturn the information in JSON format only, without additional explanation."
